# Fusion Class Notes Readme

Each handout will have its own folder. The files are shared here for group working and to prevent overwriting each other (if we just synced in dropbox, say)

using git clone for the folder will allow updating your local files with these from the repository. when you're done, push them back to bit bucket so we always have the updated versions here.
